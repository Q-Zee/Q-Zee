Hello, I’m @Q-Zee

- 👀 I’m interested in using the DWave Quantum Annealer to solve various optimization problems.
- 🌱 The work published here (in progress as of December 5th 2021) is for the purpose of demonstrating how I have used the Quantum Annealer for practice and to solve real-world problems. Some of the real-world use cases include **airline crew planning optimization problems**. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others who are looking at creating practical solvers to real work optimization problems.
